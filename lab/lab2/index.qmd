title: 'Lab 2: Multiplexed 7-Segment Display'
---

## Introduction

In this lab you will learn how to use time multiplexing to efficiently use the I/O on your FPGA.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab you will have...

* Implemented a time-multiplexing scheme to drive two seven-segment displays with a single set of FPGA I/O pins.
* Built a simple transistor circuit to drive large currents from the FPGA pins.
* Practiced your ability to build Verilog systems in a modular way.

## Requirements

Display two independent hexadecimal numbers on your dual seven-segment display. Use a DIP switch and four other input pins (possibly connected to a DIP switch on a breadboard) to provide the data for two hexadecimal numbers. You **must** use a single seven-segment decoder HDL module to drive the cathodes for both digits on the display, which therefore must be wired for multiplexed operation. Also, display the sum of the numbers on five LEDs. The seven segment display should be oriented to display the numbers upright to the viewer.

## Discussion
Time-multiplexing is a technique to share a common expensive hardware resource for several purposes at different times. For example, the multicycle processor in E85 multiplexed the memory for both instruction and data access and multiplexed the ALU for data processing instructions, branch calculations, and program counter increments.

In this lab, you will time-multiplex your seven-segment decoder module to run both halves of a dual display. A convenient way to control which half is active is to turn ON the common anode of only one display at a time. The anode requires substantial current, more than an FPGA output pin can drive. You can use a transistor to drive the large current. The lab has a stock of 2N3906 PNP transistors suitable for this purpose. Be sure to limit the base current so that you don’t draw too much current from the FPGA pin and choose a suitable switching speed. If you switch too slowly, your eye will notice the flicker. If you switch too fast for the electronics, the two digits will bleed together.

## Hints

Look at your RTL schematic in your synthesis tool (`Tools -> Netlist Analyzer`). Understand why your code produces the hardware you see. Be sure your combinational logic doesn’t have any registers. Be sure your logic has no latches or tristate buffers. The oscilloscope is handy for tracking down timing problems.
