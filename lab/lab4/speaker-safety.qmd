## Protecting Your Speaker (and MCU)

Before you connect your circuit to the 8&nbsp;Ω speaker, it is **critical** to ensure that the amplifier output and speaker load will not draw excessive current.  
Driving the speaker directly from your MCU **will damage both the MCU and the speaker**, so always check your circuit before connecting the speaker.

Refer to your speaker datasheet for the exact specifications. A typical 8&nbsp;Ω speaker datasheet will show:

::: {.callout-tip title="Measure Before You Connect"}
Always verify your output current using a dummy load (resistor) or multimeter before connecting a real speaker!

### Step 1: Measure the Output Current

1. Build your circuit **without the speaker** — instead, connect a **dummy load** such as an 8&nbsp;Ω resistor to simulate the speaker.  
2. Use a multimeter to **measure the RMS voltage drop** across the resistor while your MCU is generating the audio signal.  
3. From the measured voltage, compute the expected current using Ohm’s law:

$$
I = \frac{V}{R}
$$

If you prefer, you can measure current directly by inserting the multimeter in series with the load.

### Step 2: Stay Below Safe Limits

An LM386 amplifier can safely drive small speakers, but you must ensure that:

- The **output voltage** does not exceed approximately **1&nbsp;V RMS** (≈ 2.8&nbsp;V peak-to-peak) for conservative operation.  
- This corresponds to a **maximum RMS current** of about:

$$
I_{\text{max}} = \frac{1\,\text{V}}{8\,\Omega} = 0.125\,\text{A (125 mA)}
$$

**Note:** According to the speaker datasheet, the rated input power is **2&nbsp;W** (corresponding to ~4&nbsp;V RMS, ~500&nbsp;mA) and maximum input power is **3&nbsp;W**. The 1&nbsp;V RMS limit recommended here (~125&nbsp;mW) is intentionally conservative to provide a safety margin and prevent distortion. If you need higher volume, you can increase the voltage up to the rated limits, but always verify with measurements first.

To adjust current:
- Lower the amplifier gain (to reduce current)
- Reduce the input signal amplitude (to reduce current)
- Add a small series resistor (to reduce current)
- Increase gain/amplitude carefully if you need more volume (stay below 2&nbsp;W rated power)

### Step 3: Never Connect the MCU Pin Directly

Remember:  
- MCU GPIO pins can safely source **no more than 10–20&nbsp;mA**.  
- An 8&nbsp;Ω speaker draws **over 100&nbsp;mA** even at low volume.  

If you connect the speaker directly to the MCU, you will **fry the MCU output** and possibly the speaker.  
Always use the **LM386** amplifier to buffer the signal and supply sufficient current.

| Max safe RMS voltage     | ~1&nbsp;V                      | ~4&nbsp;V (2&nbsp;W rated) |
| Max RMS current          | ~125&nbsp;mA                   | ~500&nbsp;mA (2&nbsp;W rated) |
| Rated input power        | —                              | 2&nbsp;W          |
| Maximum input power      | —                              | 3&nbsp;W          |

By following these steps, you’ll protect both your hardware and your hearing while getting clean audio output from your MCU.
