::: {.callout-warning title="FA24 Checkoff Modification"}
Due to Prof. Brake's travel schedule, there will be no standard checkoff for this lab.
Instead of meeting with him to demonstrate the performance of your system, you must upload a video of your system in operation.
Your video should document the entire song playing.

Uploading a video directly to your Github site is **not** recommended due to the large file sizes involved.
Instead, you should upload your video to a hosting site like YouTube (you may used your HMC Google account) and then copy and paste the embed HTML code into your website.
To do so, you may use the following Quarto shortcode as shown below.
Simply replace the given URL with the URL to your video.
More information can be found in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html).
