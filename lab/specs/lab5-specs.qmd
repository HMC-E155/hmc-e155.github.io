#### Proficiency

- [ ] Design measures and displays speed of motor in units of rev/s with an update rate of at least 1 Hz.
- [ ] Measured speed matches true motor speed and direction (calculations should be provided in the report to verify this).
- [ ] Code uses interrupts (rather than polling or timers) to detect encoder pulses.
- [ ] Interrupt code does not miss any encoder pulses at normal speed.
- [ ] Motor speed is reported as zero when it is not spinning.

#### Excellence

- [ ] Design uses all edges of encoder pulses to achieve highest resolution measurement.
- [ ] MCU does not miss any pulses at high speed (Up to 24V! Don't test there for too long though) and outputs a non-zero velocity at low speeds (down to 0.1V / just above stall).
- [ ] Report compares the performance of interrupt based code to manual polling at high speeds.  This comparison is quantitative and includes the maximum revolutions/second achievable by each implementation.
