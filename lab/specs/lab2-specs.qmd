#### Proficiency

- [ ] HDL design includes only a single seven-segment decoder module.
- [ ] Sum of the numbers on the two displays is correctly displayed for all inputs
- [ ] Seven segment displays are same brightness regardless of how many segments are lit.

#### Excellence

- [ ] No noticeable bleeding of the digits between displays
- [ ] No flickering on the individual digits
- [ ] Current draw/sink on all FPGA pins are below the currents specified in the recommended operating conditions. Claims are backed up by calculations and reference to the appropriate items on the datasheet.
- [ ] Digits on the seven-segment display are upright to the viewer.
