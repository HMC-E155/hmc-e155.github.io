#### Proficiency

##### General Schematic Specifications

- [ ] All pin names labeled
- [ ] All pin numbers labeled
- [ ] Crossing wires clearly identified as junction or unconnected
- [ ] Neat layout (e.g., clear organization and spacing)
- [ ] All parts labeled with part number
- [ ] All component values present

**Block Diagram**

- [ ] Block diagram present with one block per SystemVerilog module
- [ ] Each block includes all input and output signals
	
**HDL & Code Specifications**

*General Formatting*

- [ ] Descriptive filename (e.g., `lab2_jb.sv`)
- [ ] Descriptive variable names
- [ ] Neat formatting (e.g., standard indentation, consistent formatting for variable names (kebab-case/snake_case/camelCase/PascalCase ))
- [ ] Descriptive and clear function/module names

*Comments*

- [ ] Comments to indicate the purpose of each function/module

**Lab Writeup/Summary**

- [ ] Statement of whether the design meets all the requirements. If not, list the shortcomings.
- [ ] Number of hours spent working on the lab are included.
- [ ] Writeup contains minimal spelling or grammar issues and any errors do not significantly detract from clarity of the writeup.
- [ ] (Optional) List comments or suggestions on what was particularly good about the assignment or what you think needs to change in future versions.
- [ ] AI prototype attempted and some reflection is recorded.

#### Excellence

**General Schematic Specifications	**

- [ ] Standard symbols used for all components where applicable
- [ ] Signals "flow" from left to right where possible (e.g., inputs on left hand side, outputs on right hand side)
- [ ] Title block with author name, title, and date

**HDL & Code Specifications**

*General Formatting*

- [ ] Name, email, and date at the top of every file
- [ ] Comment at the top of each source code file to describe what is in it
- [ ] Clear and organized hierarchy (e.g., delineation between top level modules and submodules)

*Testbenches*

- [ ] Testbenches written for each individual module to demonstrate proper operation
- [ ] Testbench output included in the report
