#### Proficiency

- [ ] Assembly program correctly sorts an array of signed bytes.
- [ ] Brief description of sort algorithm implemented.
- [ ] SEGGER Embedded Studio debugger used to demonstrate that the test array was sorted properly.
- [ ] Assembly code includes line-by-line comments
- [ ] Code is running on MCU connected to SEGGER Embedded Studio for instructor to verify operation with a test case of their choosing.

#### Excellence

- [ ] Report identifies all possible edge cases for sorting **and** presents testing results to verify that the design performs correctly for all the edge cases you've identified. You can demonstrate this by showing screenshots of the intial (`src`) and final (`dst`) arrays in the watch window or memory viewer.
