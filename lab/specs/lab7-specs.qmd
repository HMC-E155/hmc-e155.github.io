#### Proficiency

- [ ] AES core simulation testbench passes
- [ ] AES SPI simulation testbench passes

#### Excellence

- [ ] Design fits on FPGA hardware
- [ ] SPI communication is displayed on logic analyzer
- [ ] System fully operational (sends data from MCU to FPGA and FPGA sends the correct data back again).
